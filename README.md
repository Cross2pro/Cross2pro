### 🚀 Seeking Internship Opportunities
> **M.S. Student @ BJUT | AI Researcher | Ex-BSP Engineer**
>
> I am currently looking for an **Algorithm** or **R&D Internship** where I can leverage my unique background in both **High-Level AI (LLM/CV)** and **Low-Level Systems (Linux/BSP)**.

### 🎓 About Me
- 🏫 **Master's Candidate** at **Beijing University of Technology** (北京工业大学), School of Information Technology.
- 🔬 **Current Focus:** Researching **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Computer Vision (CV)**.
- ⚙️ **Engineering Roots:** I have a strong foundation in **Embedded Linux (BSP)** and **Reverse Engineering**, giving me a deep understanding of how software interacts with hardware.
- 💡 **Philosophy:** *"From Kernel to Model"* — I believe the best AI systems are built by understanding the entire stack, from the driver level up to the neural network.
